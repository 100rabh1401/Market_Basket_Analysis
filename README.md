### Market_Basket_Analysis
My objective for this piece of work is to carry out a Market Basket Analysis as an end-to-end data science project. I have split the output into __THREE PARTS__ that I have organised as follows:
1. In the __first__ chapter, I will source, explore and format a complex dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithms.
2. For the __second__ part, I will apply various machine learning algorithms for Product Recommendation and select the best performing model. This will be done with the support of the __recommenderlab__ package.
3. In the __third__ and final instalment, I will implement the selected model in a Shiny Web Application.
